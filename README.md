# Edgeless-GNN-external

Run 'main.py' for the experiments on Cora. For the other datasets, change the import code for the dataset in pytorch_geometric (for details, please refer to: https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/1.6.1/modules/datasets.html).
The code is implemented in:
- Pytorch 1.5.1
- Pytorch Geometric: 1.6.1
- Scikit-learn: 0.23.1

Additional experimental results are in 'Additional_experiment.md'.
